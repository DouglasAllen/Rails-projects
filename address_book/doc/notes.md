Rails needs the following:

    activesupport, "= 4.0.0"
    actionpack, "= 4.0.0" 
    activerecord, "= 4.0.0" 
    actionmailer, "= 4.0.0"
    railties, "= 4.0.0"
    bundler, "< 2.0", ">= 1.3.0"
    sprockets-rails, "~> 2.0.0"
    
    But it also uses the following.

       Ruby std lib:
       
				Set
        FileUtils
        YAML
        Date
        Logger




      Gems:

        redcarpet
        nokogiri
        kindlerb
        minitest
				sqlite3
